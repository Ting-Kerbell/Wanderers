“Beetle Juice” responds by telling you that the fusion that was causing them to expand before has now stopped, causing their core to compress and become extremely dense. This results in helium fusion, resulting in a much more rapid rate of expansion (you noticed they were putting on weight but kept your mouth shut so as not to be rude. However, helium fusion is unsustainable and therefore their time in the universe has come to an end. Because of their huge mass, they explode in a Supernova, and eventually turn into a neutron star, essentially a shell of their former self.

What a brilliant idea.
