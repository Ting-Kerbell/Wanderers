Youâ€™re a star! Not like an achievement kind of star, but youâ€™re just a star. A massive star to be more specific. Your imaginary mom sent you a call saying your brother, Todd,  has become her favorite child because youâ€™ve done nothing with your life, and sheâ€™s right. You havenâ€™t really done anything. 
But hereâ€™s your chance. You hear that dingus Chad is having a crazy frat party in a few billion years. This sounds exactly like the type of thing that you could do something about, if only you could do something to ruin it.
