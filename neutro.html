After you supernova into a Neutron star, “Beetle Juice” and you become more and more gravitationally attracted to each other, spinning closer and closer at a faster and faster rate due to the conservation of angular momentum (you’re not sure why you know this, but you think you should maybe write a paper or something after all of this craziness), you feel like your merger is just about to happen, and with the pending creation of an extremely strong magnetic field, you feel as if you’re about to burst a plasma jet of protons, positrons and electrons, known as a jet (1). Kind of like a number two, but faster and deadlier. As you sense the jet ready to eject out of your now combined masses, you want to time the jet based on your rotation at an angle towards Chad’s position, by either holding it in for a little longer or just letting go. Are you ready to ruin Chad’s rager?
