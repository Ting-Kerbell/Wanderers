Wow, against all odds, you have managed to do it. You have a GRB heading straight to earth. You don’t know how, but it happened. It might only last between a few milliseconds to a few minutes, but the high intensity gamma ray light you emit has the potential to do some real harm. (3) <br> <br>
Great! Now, are you going to try to vaporize the Earth, or just destroy the ozone layer?

A Gamma Ray Burst has the potential to ionize the molecules in the atmosphere, depleting the ozone layer and exposing life on Earth to the Sun’s deadly ultraviolet radiation. Let’s just take him out. Teach him a lesson.
