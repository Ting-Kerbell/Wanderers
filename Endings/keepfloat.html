	This isn’t how the universe works. You accomplish nothing, and Chad proceeds to live a long and fulfilling life. He finds love, gets a wife and kids, and has a long and productive career in the Peace Corps. He dies peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by the ones he loved. All because you didn’t ruin his rager with gamma ray bursts. Great. Just great.
