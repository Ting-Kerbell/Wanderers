You’re a star! Not like an achievement kind of star, but you’re just a star. A massive star to be more specific. Your imaginary mom sent you a call saying your brother, Todd,  has become her favorite child because you’ve done nothing with your life, and she’s right. You haven’t really done anything. 
But here’s your chance. You hear that dingus Chad is having a crazy frat party in a few billion years, better yet, he’s in the same galaxy as you (The Milky Way). This sounds exactly like the type of thing that you could do something about, if only you could do something to ruin it.
