	Through your telekinetic powers, you are able to transfer your mind to a cat on Earth! You channel your rage into the cat, and the cat proceeds to throw a fit in the house it lives in, scratching up the sofa, biting the owners, and slaying any squirrel in sight. Unfortunately, the cat lives in a separate country from Chad, and does not ruin the frat party.
