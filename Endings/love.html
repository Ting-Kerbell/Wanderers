	You lose sight in your goal to end that Cockalorum Chad’s stupid rager, in favor of a bigger goal in life: Love. From small talk, you and the sun begin to go into deeper conversations, and find that you two have a lot in common! You both like spin class, you hate the Mets, AND you’re both enormous celestial bodies floating around in space. You want nothing more than to spend the rest of your cycle floating in space with “The Sun”, and that’s exactly what you two do. And you two lived happily ever after.

    But still, you still didn't ruin Chad's party. Sad!
